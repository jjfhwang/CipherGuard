# CipherGuard

## Description

CipherGuard is a TypeScript library designed to provide robust and flexible cryptographic tools for securing sensitive data. It offers a suite of encryption, decryption, hashing, and key derivation functions, allowing developers to easily integrate strong security measures into their applications. CipherGuard prioritizes ease of use, performance, and adherence to industry best practices, ensuring that data is protected against unauthorized access and manipulation. This library aims to simplify the complexities of cryptography, making it accessible to developers of all skill levels.

## Features

*   **AES Encryption/Decryption:** Implements Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with various key sizes (128, 192, 256 bits) and modes of operation (CBC, CTR, GCM) for symmetric encryption. Provides strong confidentiality for data at rest and in transit.
*   **Hashing Algorithms:** Includes secure hashing algorithms such as SHA-256 and SHA-512 for generating one-way hash values of data. Useful for verifying data integrity and storing passwords securely.
*   **Key Derivation Function (PBKDF2):** Provides Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) for securely deriving cryptographic keys from passwords. Incorporates salting and iteration counts to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   **Random Number Generation:** Offers a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) for generating secure keys, initialization vectors (IVs), and other random data.
*   **Data Serialization/Deserialization:** Utilities for safely serializing and deserializing data before encryption and after decryption, ensuring data integrity during the process.

## Installation

To install CipherGuard, you'll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.  Follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CipherGuard.git
    cd CipherGuard
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript files in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use CipherGuard in your TypeScript code:

**AES Encryption and Decryption:**

```typescript
import { AesGcm } from './src/aes'; // Adjust path as needed
import { generateRandomKey, generateRandomIv } from './src/utils';

async function encryptAndDecrypt() {
  const key = generateRandomKey(256); // Generate a 256-bit key
  const iv = generateRandomIv(16); // Generate a 16-byte IV

  const data = 'This is the secret message.';
  const aesGcm = new AesGcm(key, iv);

  try {
    const encryptedData = await aesGcm.encrypt(data);
    console.log('Encrypted Data:', encryptedData);

    const decryptedData = await aesGcm.decrypt(encryptedData);
    console.log('Decrypted Data:', decryptedData); // Output: This is the secret message.
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Encryption/Decryption Error:', error);
  }
}

encryptAndDecrypt();
```

**Hashing with SHA-256:**

```typescript
import { sha256 } from './src/hashing'; // Adjust path as needed

async function hashData() {
  const data = 'Password123';
  const hash = await sha256(data);
  console.log('SHA-256 Hash:', hash);
}

hashData();
```

**Key Derivation with PBKDF2:**

```typescript
import { pbkdf2 } from './src/keyDerivation'; // Adjust path as needed

async function deriveKey() {
  const password = 'mySecretPassword';
  const salt = 'someRandomSalt';
  const iterations = 10000;
  const keyLength = 32; // 32 bytes = 256 bits

  try {
    const derivedKey = await pbkdf2(password, salt, iterations, keyLength, 'sha256');
    console.log('Derived Key:', derivedKey);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Key Derivation Error:', error);
  }
}

deriveKey();
```

**Note:** Replace `"./src/aes"`, `"./src/hashing"`, and `"./src/keyDerivation"` with the actual paths to the corresponding modules in your project. The `generateRandomKey` and `generateRandomIv` functions are assumed to be utility functions for generating cryptographically secure random keys and IVs, located in a `utils.ts` file.
